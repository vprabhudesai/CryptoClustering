# 🧠 CryptoClustering


This project applies unsupervised machine learning to explore patterns in cryptocurrency data. It leverages clustering techniques like KMeans and PCA to group assets and derive insights about market structure and volatility.


## 📌 Project Objectives


- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on crypto market data
- Normalize and preprocess features for clustering
- Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality
- Apply KMeans clustering to identify similar asset groups
- Visualize the results using 2D and 3D plots


## 🛠 Technologies Used


- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Features


- Data normalization and scaling
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Elbow method for optimal K value
- KMeans clustering
- 2D and 3D cluster visualizations


## 📈 Sample Insights


- Groups cryptos based on risk-return profiles
- Highlights asset clusters that behave similarly
- Demonstrates how unsupervised learning can inform portfolio design


## 🚀 Future Enhancements


- Integrate real-time crypto data via API (CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap)
- Build a web app to explore clusters interactively
- Add evaluation metrics and deeper cluster analysis
